# Skills-Gap-Project
A small project I made for my Skills Gap which has allowed me to learn, and experiment with professional, and efficient practices that were new to me. 

There are a few sections containing unecessary code that I wish I could've changed at the time to further refine the code, but since this was a College related project, I didn't have time :)
